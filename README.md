## Introduction

Diwali is one of the most significant festivals in India, and businesses often see a surge in sales during this period. This analysis aims to better understand customer behavior during Diwali sales and make data-driven recommendations to improve customer experience and sales strategies.

## Data Source

The data used for this analysis is available in the `data/` directory. It includes information about customer demographics, product categories, and sales transactions.

## Analysis Process

1. **Data Preprocessing**: The data is cleaned, missing values are handled, and relevant columns are selected for analysis.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: EDA is performed on various customer attributes, such as age, gender, marital status, occupation, product category, and state. Various graphs and visualizations are generated to gain insights.

3. **Conclusion**: Based on the EDA, conclusions are drawn about the customer segments that are more likely to make purchases during Diwali. The main conclusion is highlighted in the README.

4. **Recommendations**: Suggestions are provided for improving customer experience and sales strategies based on the analysis results.

## File Structure
